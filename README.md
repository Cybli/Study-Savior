Study Savior is a campus-focused application designed to help students discover new study locations throughout campus and connect with their peers to form study groups. This platform provides information about study locations using user-submitted reviews and ratings. Locations are rated based on comfort, noise level, crowdedness, and vibe. These ratings are all combined to create an at-a-glance consensus on a study location, with further information being available if needed. This project hopes to encourage students to meet new people and explore campus, all while maintaining productivity.
